# SimpleProjTodo

# Preliminary tasks
- make a github account
- set up vscode and link github account to it

## syncing the two
First you have to know basic git terms like `repo`, `push`, `pull`, `commit`, & `clone`
Then look for the green 'code' button on this repo's page and copy the https link.
Easist way to clone a repo in vscode is to do the shortcut, `ctrl + shit + p` and search for the command `Git: clone`, then paste the link into the prompt.
Place the cloned repo in a destination of your choice, and now you have copied this README.md and project files.

## (side note)
Start off good habits by using proper naming conventions. There are many ways to write variable names, file names, function/mehtod names, but most common and standard is to use 'snake_case'
Learn to separate words by underscores will just help with convience over time.

# task 1
Directions are going to be quite vague, but this will help build the process of problem solving and learning how to approach problems like a computer scientist. 
Use google, use chat gpt, use literally anything to just learn. If you don't know what something is or means, look it up, find examples, and test some things on your own to help you build comprehension on a subject.

## 1.1 Hello_World.py
Only other file in this repo is this python file. Figure out how to run it.
A couple guidance hints would be:
- install python
- it's pretty straight forward lol

# 1.2 Real World Use
It's often difficult to figure out on your own how to apply what you learn to things in your own life or practical things int he real world, so I'll just give you something.
A fundemental term in data science is 'preprocessing', specifically the preprocessing of data, as you know data science kinda interacts with a lot of data and yeah you get the gist. 
So here's the goal, write a python script that will convert all the `.png` files into `.jpg` files in a given directory. Additionally, have it track how much time it takes to do this conversion and print result.
Here is the dataset of images you are to use: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vishalsubbiah/pokemon-images-and-types
